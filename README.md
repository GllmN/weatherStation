Creation an application with Node.js with one or more API request.

It's an application weather geolocalisable with temperature and wind.

A API request based to openweather.org with data JSON : https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=nantes&appid=13c57efc2c9158a847613fd0231ce56a&units=metric

Please don't share a API Key because it's issue of my personnal account.
